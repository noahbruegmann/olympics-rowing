# olympics-rowing
Super quick cut analysis of Olympic rowing results 2016.

CSV is a manual copy of the placings from the Olympic regatta by boat class and country. Analysis script in R is some very simple aggregating of that data.

Some possible things that I'd be very interested to do or see done are to add in some data about predictions (e.g. Row2k Pick'em style data) to see what kind of systematic biases people have. For example, I'd be willing to bet people from English-speaking countries over-predict performance of Enlish-speaking boats.
